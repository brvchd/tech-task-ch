Thoughts about task solution
  I decided to prioritise each country on the map. Countries which create the shortest path from North to South have priority - 1. Other countries has priority - 2.
 
Pros of the solution
  The idea itself is simple and does not overcomplicate the solution to the task having decent performance.
  
Cons of the solution
  Solution it self cannot be called generic. Therefore, behaviour with additional set of countries is not 100% predictable.
