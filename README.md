<h2>Thoughts about task solution</h2>
<p>I decided to prioritise each country on the map. Countries which create the shortest path from North to South have priority - 1. Other countries has priority - 2.</p> 
<h3>Pros of the solution</h3>
<p>The idea itself is simple and does not overcomplicate the solution to the task having decent performance.</p>  
<h3>Cons of the solution</h3>
  <p>Solution it self cannot be called generic. Therefore, behaviour with additional set of countries is not 100% predictable.</p>
